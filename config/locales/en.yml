    hints:
      project:
        name: What's the name of your project? Choose with care, because this will influence the chances of your project reaching the goal.
        video_url: Paste the URL from a <a href="http://vimeo.com" target="_blank">Vimeo</a> video. We chose Vimeo because it looks better and doesn't have ads. This way, your project will look better too! <strong>Produce your video the best you can and make a video specifically for your campaign</strong>. If there is a single thing that differentiates the projects that reach the goal from the others is the video. Observe ;)
        about: Tell us a little about what you want to do, how much you need and what for. Be brief and punctual, but don't forget to give the readers something that moves them. After all, it's your creation and they need to see your passion taking place!
        headline: Summarize your project in 140 characters. This sentence will be the first contact people will have with your project, before even seeing the video. Be creative, clear and direct :)
        category: Choose in which category you want your project to appear. Don't worry if you think it fits in more than one. Choose the one where you want people to find your project.
        goal: Think hard about the amount you will ask for. It should be the <strong>minimum necessary for the project to happen</strong>. Nothing more, nothing less. If you ask too much, your chances of reaching the minimum will be lower; if you don't ask for enough, you won't be able to execute the project and consequently will have your reputation damaged, hindering future achievements.
        expires_at: "Finally, choose how long you want your campaign to last. Again, this is a strategic choice: if you put a lot of time, people will lose interest along the way; if put too little, you may not reach the minimum in time."
      reward:
        description: Describe your reward in a way that arouses people's interest to back the project. Don't be shy!
