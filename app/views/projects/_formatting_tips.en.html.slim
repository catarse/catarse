  ul
    li
      | If you paste the URL of an image or a video from Vimeo or YouTube, they will be embedded in your comment. Try it on!
    li
      | When you paste any other URL, it will become a link. For example, http://catarse.me will become
      a href="#{Configuration[:base_url]}" target="_blank" #{Configuration[:base_url]}
      | .
    li
      | If you want to add some text to the link, just use the following format:
      strong "the text you want":http://your.url
      | . For example, "#{Configuration[:company_name]}":http://catarse.me will become
      a href="#{Configuration[:base_url]}" target="_blank" #{Configuration[:company_name]}
      | .
    li
      | You can use
      strong bold
      | just adding an asterisk (*) before and after the text you want to format. For example, *my bold text* will be shown as
      strong my bold text
      | .
    li
      | You can use
      em italic
      | just adding an underline (_) before and after the text you want to format. For example, _my italic text_ will be shown as
      em my italic text
      | .
