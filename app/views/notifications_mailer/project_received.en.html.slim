|Hi, #{user.name}!
br
br
|Thank you very much for trusting Catarse with your project :)
br
br
|Before we begin, we would like to remind you how the project selection works here on Catarse. There are 4 steps:
br
br
|1 - You just filled that beatiful form and we received it;
br
br
|2 - Our team will answer you in up to 4 working days. It's not necessarily a Yes or No answer, we will certainly exchange some emails before the project goes online.
br
br
|3 - When your project is ready, we will send you a special link to submit your project;
br
br
|4 - You will then need to tell us that the project has been submitted and we will authorize it so everyone can see and back it (if they want to, right?).
br
br
|Important information: if you forgot to include something in the submitted form, no problems, you can add new information (or change them) when our team contacts you, ok?
br
br
|Meanwhile, take a look at some projects (#{link_to "#{I18n.t('site.base_url')}/explore" ,"#{I18n.t('site.base_url')}/explore"}) and - if you like them- make a pledge! This is the best way to show that you believe in the crowdfunding culture in Brazil and promote the ecosystem around Catarse. Not to mention, getting some inspiration for your own project.
br
br
|Stay tuned to Catarse on  #{link_to 'Facebook', I18n.t('site.facebook', :locale => user.locale)} and #{link_to 'Twitter', "twitter.com/#{I18n.t('site.twitter')}" } and know more about Catarse reading our posts on #{link_to 'blog', I18n.t('site.blog', :locale => user.locale)}.
br
br
|If you have any questions, contact us on: #{mail_to I18n.t('site.email.contact', :locale => user.locale)}
br
br
|A big hug,
br
