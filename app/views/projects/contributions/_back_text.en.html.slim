h2 I want to back, what’s next?
h3 How can I back this project?
p First, define the value of your contribution and choose a reward. Then click on “Review and make a payment”  to redirect you to the next page to complete your payment.
h3 When payment is effected?
p Once the MoIP or Paypal confirm the transaction (card and bank transfer confirmation is on the same day, lead slips to 4 working days to be confirmed). Then, if the project does not reach #{@project.display_goal} by #{@project.display_expires_at}, you will receive your money back in the form of credits on #{Configuration[:company_name]}.
h3 Then I get my money back if the project does not go out?
p Yes! You receive back 100% of what you paid in the form of credits to support other projects on #{Configuration[:company_name]}.
h3 And if I do not want to use the credits in #{Configuration[:company_name]}?
p No problem. Just enter the #{link_to t('credits.title'), user_path(current_user, anchor: :credits), :target => :_blank} tab, 60 days after their support and request a chargeback. If you have paid by credit card, the reversal will be done on your next bill. If you paid with debit or bank, the only way to do the chargeback is you open an account on MoIP. Then we transfer the value of our account to yours and from there you transfer to your bank account.
h3 If the project is funded, how do I get my reward?
p When your reward is ready, #{link_to @project.user.display_name, user_path(@project.user)} will contact you to arrange delivery.
