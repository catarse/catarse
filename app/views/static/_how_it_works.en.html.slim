|#{Configuration[:company_name]} works like this: you submit your project, tell us
strong how much do you need
|and a
strong deadline
|to reach this goal. Then you promote the project and people can opt to
strong back with any amount
|starting from R$10 and
strong receive rewards
|for that! If until the chosen deadline you have reached the amount you need, you get the money. Otherwise, everybody receives the money back. Simple like that.
