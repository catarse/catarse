      title_money: "Where does the money to finance projects come from?"
      money: "At least 50% will come from your own network of contacts. In this manner, Catarse is a way for you to get closer to the people that enjoy your work and expand this network through sharing in social networks, newspapers, blogs and, of course, your favorite bar."
      title_work: "Does it take a lot of work?"

      legend_html: "Having clear answers to these questions will help tremendously in structuring your project, <br>increasing the chances that it will be successful."
      title_one: "What inspired you to make this project?"
      tip_one: "People only engage when they realize the importance of a cause for society or for the person who leads a campaign. So be very clear about what is your inspiration and let it overflow into your project."
      title_two: "What is the focus?"
      tip_two: "Catarse is an excellent way to take the first steps. Therefore, define very well the purpose of your project, as well as who will benefit from it. Clearly defining your objectives is one of the best ways to engage people."
      title_three: "What is your goal?"
      tip_three: "Calculate all costs for the project execution and rewards delivery. Also take into account your ability to engage people in order to define your financial goal."
      title_four: "What is your deadline for the fundraising?"
      tip_four: "Don't underestimate the work of a campaign. You will have to work hard during the entire period the project is live, so, it's recommended that you don't tire yourself too much in this process. Our recommendation: 40 days of campaign."
      title_five: "Have you thought about the project rewards?"
      tip_five: "Remember that rewards are public promises. So, think very well when elaborating them, as well as the logistics in delivering them to your contributions. Our suggestion: think about immaterial rewards: downloads, experiences, courses e kisses."
      title_six: "Is your video ready?"
      tip_six: "The video is the business card of your project. It's through it that the contributions will get in touch with your cause. So, take special care in the script, audio and image quality. HD is recommended."
      title_seven: "How will you mobilize your network?"
      tip_seven: "You need to have a clear idea on how you will stir your network and convince it to contribute your project. Distribute your work weekly and change your approach with the network according to how close you are to it."
      title_eight: "How will the money be used?"
      tip_eight: "Create a GOOGLE DOCS spreadsheet and open your budget to show everyone how the money will be used. TRANSPARENCY is everything."
